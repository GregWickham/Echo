# Echo - A bridge from CoreNLP to SimpleNLG

Echo does two things:

1.  Take the output of the Stanford CoreNLP annotation pipeline, and transform it into a specification that can be realized by SimpleNLG; and
2.  Provide a user interface that can inspect the transformed specification as a directed graph.
