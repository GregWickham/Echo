# Echo - A bridge from CoreNLP to SimpleNLG

Echo does two things:

1.  Transform output from the [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) annotation [pipeline](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/pipeline.html) into a specification that can be realized by [SimpleNLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg); and
2.  Provide a user interface that can inspect the transformed specification as a directed graph.

For documentation, please refer to the [Echo project site on GitHub.](https://gregwickham.github.io/Echo/)
